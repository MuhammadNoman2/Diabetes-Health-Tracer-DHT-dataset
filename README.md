# Diabetes-Health-Tracer-DHT-dataset

## Overview
The **Diabetes Health Tracer (DHT)** dataset was created by merging and processing data from three publicly available datasets to facilitate advanced machine learning research on diabetes prediction. This dataset is part of the study titled: *Machine Learning-Driven Diabetes Health Tracer (DHT): Optimizing Prognosis using RaSK GraDe and RaSK GraDeL Models*.

# Diabetes Health Tracer (DHT) Dataset

## Overview
The **Diabetes Health Tracer (DHT)** dataset was created by merging and processing data from three publicly available datasets to facilitate advanced machine learning research on diabetes prediction. This dataset is part of the study titled: *Machine Learning-Driven Diabetes Health Tracer (DHT): Optimizing Prognosis using RaSK GraDe and RaSK GraDeL Models*.

## Source Datasets
The following publicly available datasets were used in the creation of the DHT dataset:
